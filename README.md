# Peripheral monocytes reflect an inflammatory state in claudin-low breast cancer  

Claudin-low breast cancers constitute a rare and aggressive subtype defined by the loss of epithelial junctional components and acquisition of mesenchymal and stem-like features. Although considered among the most primitive forms of breast malignancy, their cellular origin and development remain unclear. Unlike other subtypes, claudin-low tumors display low genomic instability, mutational burden, and proliferative indices, yet display extensive immune and stromal cell infiltration. While most investigations have focused on their epigenetic and methylation landscapes, less is known about their systemic immunological characteristics. In this study, we used transcriptome-based stratification of claudin-low tumors, investigated their immune landscape, and identified a peripheral prognostic biomarker  that bridges tumor-intrinsic states with systemic immune alterations.
